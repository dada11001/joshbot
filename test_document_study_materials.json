    "main_summary": "This introductory chapter on thermodynamics establishes fundamental concepts crucial for understanding energy transformations. It defines a thermodynamic system, its properties (intensive and extensive), and the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium.  The chapter emphasizes that any change a system undergoes is a process, with quasi-static processes being those that proceed infinitesimally close to equilibrium.  The core principle introduced is the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that energy is conserved – it can only change form, not be created or destroyed. This principle is foundational for analyzing various thermal systems.",
